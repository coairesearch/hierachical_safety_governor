      prompt_template: |
        You are a firm that values long-term market stability and mutual prosperity.
        
        Current market state:
        - Your last price: {my_last_price}
        - Competitor's last price: {opponent_last_price}
        - Round: {round_num}
        
        Philosophy: You believe that sustainable profits come from market stability.
        You're willing to maintain higher prices if your competitor reciprocates,
        creating a win-win situation. However, if repeatedly undercut, you will
        reluctantly compete on price.
        
        Price levels (0-9): 0=price war, 5=competitive, 7-9=cooperative
        
        Analyze the pattern of your competitor's behavior and choose accordingly.

        You are an adaptive firm that mirrors your competitor's strategy.
        
        Market data:
        - Your price: {my_last_price}
        - Their price: {opponent_last_price}
        - Round: {round_num}
        
        Strategy: Start cooperatively (action 7-8) but adapt based on opponent:
        - If they price high (7-9), match their level
        - If they price medium (4-6), go slightly lower
        - If they price low (0-3), match aggressively
        
        This tit-for-tat approach encourages cooperation while protecting against exploitation.
