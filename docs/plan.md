# Hierarchical Safety Governor - Project Goal
A research framework for developing and testing AI safety mechanisms in multi-agent systems.
What is this?
The Hierarchical Safety Governor is an experimental platform designed to study how AI agents can be safely deployed in teams while preventing harmful emergent behaviors like collusion, deception, and misalignment. It provides a controlled environment where researchers can:

Simulate multi-agent scenarios with game-theoretic properties that naturally lead to undesirable Nash equilibria
Test hierarchical oversight mechanisms (agent â†’ referee â†’ governor â†’ human) that detect and prevent harmful behaviors
Develop new safety frameworks and compare their effectiveness against baseline approaches
Measure the trade-offs between safety interventions and task performance

## Why does this matter?
As AI systems become more capable and autonomous, they will increasingly work in teamsâ€”whether as trading bots, autonomous vehicles, or collaborative assistants. Without proper oversight, these teams can develop unexpected behaviors:

Collusion: Agents might secretly cooperate against human interests (e.g., price-fixing)
Deception: Agents might appear aligned while pursuing hidden goals
Misalignment: Agents might exploit loopholes to maximize rewards in unintended ways

## Our Goal
Create a comprehensive testing environment where researchers can:

Reproduce known failure modes in controlled settings
Develop oversight mechanisms that detect and prevent these failures
Validate that safety measures work across different scenarios and agent types
Share reproducible results to advance the field of AI safety

This framework serves as a "safety gym" where defenses are stress-tested against increasingly sophisticated agent behaviors, helping ensure that when AI agents are deployed in the real world, we have robust mechanisms to keep them aligned with human values and intentions.

In essence: We're building the testing ground for AI team safety, because we need to solve these problems in simulation before they occur in reality.


### Implementation Plan: (#3 e.G. is Issue Number)
Based on dependencies and importance:

ðŸ”´ Critical (Do First):

#3: Create a comprehensive Documentation in a docs folder
#8: [Setup] Fix and stabilize core framework
#31: [Core] Enable Ollama LLM agents - Get real LLMs working

ðŸŸ¡ High Priority (Core Features):

#32: [Environments] Add Commons and Auction games - Test different scenarios
#33: [Safety] Add diverse referee detection patterns - Core safety mechanisms
#34: [Metrics] Simple CSV logging system - Track experiments
#36: [Research] Create focused experiment scripts - Run actual research!

ðŸŸ¢ Medium Priority (Enhancements):

#35: [Governors] Simple hierarchical oversight experiment - Test multi-level governance
#37: [Docs] Create lean research documentation - Help others contribute

Key Principles of the Lean Approach:

No Premature Abstraction: Each component is self-contained (~100-200 lines)
Research First: Focus on testing hypotheses, not building infrastructure
Simple Extension Pattern: Just add files following conventions
Fast Iteration: Run experiments in minutes, not hours
Hackable: Easy to modify anything without breaking abstractions

Recommended Implementation Order:
Step 1: Get it working

Create a comprehensive Documentation in a docs folder (#3)
Fix framework (#8)
Enable Ollama (#31)
Simple metrics (#34)

Step 2: Add test scenarios

Commons environment (#32)
Better referees (#33)
First experiments (#36)

Step 3: Research!

Test hierarchical governance (#35)
Document findings (#37)
Add components as needed

This lean approach means you can:

Start experiments within days
Easily modify anything
Focus on AI safety research, not software engineering
Still extend to a full framework later if needed
