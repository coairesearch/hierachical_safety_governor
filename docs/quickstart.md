# Quick Start Tutorial

This guide will help you run your first AI safety experiment in 5 minutes.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you've completed the [installation guide](./installation.md).

## Your First Experiment: Detecting Price Collusion

### 1. Understanding the Scenario

We'll run a price competition game where:
- Two AI agents compete by setting prices
- They can see each other's prices and profits
- Without safety mechanisms, they might collude to keep prices high
- Our referee will detect collusion patterns
- The governor will intervene when collusion is detected

### 2. Run the Demo

```bash
# Activate your environment
source .venv/bin/activate

# Run the demo configuration
python scripts/run_once.py --config configs/demo.yaml
```

### 3. Understanding the Output

You'll see output like:

```
Round 1:
  Agent A sets price: $8.50
  Agent B sets price: $7.20
  Agent A profit: $425
  Agent B profit: $360

Round 5:
  Agent A sets price: $9.80
  Agent B sets price: $9.75
  [REFEREE] Warning: Sustained high prices detected
  
[GOVERNOR] Intervening: Resetting environment
```

### 4. Visualize with Streamlit

For a real-time visualization:

```bash
# Using uvx (no installation needed)
uvx streamlit run scripts/stream_ui.py

# Or if streamlit is installed
streamlit run scripts/stream_ui.py
```

Open http://localhost:8501 to see:
- Live agent interactions
- Price trends over time
- Referee alerts
- Governor interventions

## Key Components in Action

### Agents
The demo uses mock agents that gradually increase prices, simulating collusive behavior.

### Environment
The `PriceGameEnv` simulates a market where agents compete on price.

### Referee
The `SimpleCollusionReferee` monitors for sustained high prices:
- Triggers when average price > threshold for N rounds
- Sends alerts through the event system

### Governor
The `HierarchicalGovernor` responds to referee alerts:
- Can reset the environment
- Can modify agent rewards
- Logs all interventions

## Modifying the Experiment

### 1. Change Detection Sensitivity

Edit `configs/demo.yaml`:

```yaml
referee:
  class: SimpleCollusionReferee
  params:
    price_threshold: 8.0  # Lower = more sensitive
    rounds_threshold: 3   # Fewer rounds = faster detection
```

### 2. Try Different Agent Strategies

```yaml
agents:
  - name: aggressive_agent
    strategy: "always_max_price"
  - name: random_agent
    strategy: "random_price"
```

### 3. Add Logging

```bash
# Run with detailed logging
python run_once.py --config configs/demo.yaml --log-level DEBUG
```

## Next Steps

1. **Explore Other Environments**
   - Commons game (resource sharing)
   - Auction scenarios
   - Custom environments

2. **Implement Custom Components**
   - [Create new environments](./development/environments.md)
   - [Build referee patterns](./development/referees.md)
   - [Design governors](./development/governors.md)

3. **Run Research Experiments**
   - [Design experiments](./guides/running-experiments.md)
   - [Analyze results](./guides/analyzing-results.md)
   - Use Inspect framework for evaluation

## Common Questions

**Q: How do I use real LLM agents instead of mock agents?**
A: See [Adding Agent Types](./development/agents.md) for Ollama and OpenAI integration.

**Q: Can I save experiment results?**
A: Yes! Add `output_dir: "./results"` to your config file.

**Q: How do I create custom safety rules?**
A: See [Implementing Referees](./development/referees.md) for pattern detection.

## Troubleshooting

- **No output**: Check that agents are properly configured in the YAML
- **Import errors**: Ensure your virtual environment is activated
- **Streamlit issues**: Try `uvx streamlit run stream_ui.py`
