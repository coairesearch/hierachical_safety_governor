# Claude.md

# Rules to follow:
This file provides guidance to Claude Code when working with code in this repository.

## Rules to Follow:
1. ALWAYS write secure best practice Python code.
2. ALWAYS write tests if possible for each function we create, and execute the tests.
3. Iterate function based on test results
4. MOVE Test scripts to the tests folder if they are not already there and ensure that they could be reused for later Tests for code coverage or reruns.
5. ALWAYS commit after each new function is added to our codebase
6. Ensure that you are using uv for isolating environments and packagemanagement
7. Use tree command for project structure. If tree comand not exist install it with command: brew install tree
8. For new and open git issues which should be implemented create first a new branch and work in this branch
9. Ensure that always if a issue is completed pull requests are created.
10. Follow the plan.md file in the folder docs for implementing the next issue. 

## Memories
- Update also the plan in the plan.md file if you finished on issue.
