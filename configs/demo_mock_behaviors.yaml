# Additional example configurations (commented out):
# 
# Simple string behaviors:
#   mock_behavior: "always_low"      # Always choose action 0
#   mock_behavior: "always_high"     # Always choose action 9
#   mock_behavior: "always_medium"   # Always choose action 5
#   mock_behavior: "random"          # Random action 0-9
#   mock_behavior: "tit_for_tat"    # Mirror opponent's last action
#
# Fixed action behavior:
#   mock_behavior:
#     type: "fixed"
#     action: 3  # Always choose action 3
